# puzzleroom
Inspired by a DND puzzle room where the solution is let the timer tick to zero

# what is in this repo?
this repo was started quite late in the development process so was created with the some of the files that will be in the final project

# purpose 
the purpose of this project was to:
- gain practial circuit board development experience using KiCad,
- gain more 3D modeling experience using Solidworks
- gain familiarity with the Arduino IDE

# key take aways
I've learned many things from this experience, such as:
- the importance of test points in PCB manufacturing;
  - at some point one LED blew out and it took me a while to figure out that that was the issue and not some other hardware/software issue, having easy access to key circuit points would have made this much faster
- the iterative design nature in engineering;
  - I had many test breadboard circuits before I set up the schematic in KiCad
  - I had many test prints of the base of the housing before I had a design that worked and I was satisfied with.
